# Human Resources Management

## Human Resources Plan

In the Develop Human Resource Plan process, you plan out exactly which resources
you'll need, what their roles and responsibilities are, and how you'll train your
team and make sure they stay motivated

Acquire Project Team
Once the project gets started, you need to put together your team. This means you may
need to negotiate for some of the resources.

Develop Project Team
You'll need to train your team, and keep them motivated with rewards in order to get the
project done.

## Manage Project Team

No project goes perfectly. People have conflicts, and it's up to you to make sure
they get resolved.

## Stages of team development

- **Forming** - People are still trying to figure out their roles in the group; they tend to work
independently, but are trying to get along with each other.

- **Storming** - As the team learns more about the project, members form opinions
about how the work should be done. This can lead to temper flare-ups in the
beginning, when people disagree about how to approach the project.

- **Norming** - As the team learns more about the other people on the team, they begin to
adjust their own work habits to help out each other and the team. Here's where the
individuals on the team start learning to trust each other.

- **Performing** - Once everyone understands the problem and what each other are capable
of doing, they start acting as a cohsesive unit and being efficient. Now the team is
working like a well-oiled machine.

- **Adjourning** - When the work is close to completion, the team starts dealing with the fact
that the project is going to be closing soon.

## Managing your team means solving problems

- **Conflict management** is one of the most important tools in Manage Project Team, because
it's where you resolve conflicts between people.

- **Project performance** appraisals means looking at each person's work and assessing his or
her performance.

- **Issue logs** are really useful for keeping track of any issue, problem or conflict that happens
throughout the project. As each issue is resolved, write down the resolution.

- **Interpersonal skills** are all about helping the people on your team to solve problems.

- **Observation and conversation** are how you communicate to manage your team.

## How to resolve a conflict

Confronting-or problem-solving-is the most effective way to resolve a conflict.When
you confront the source of the conflict head-on and work with everyone to find a solution
that actually fixes the reason that conflicts happen, then the problem is most likely to
go away and never come back!

Compromise sounds good, doesn't it? But hold on a second-when two people compromise,
it means that each person gives up something. That's why a lot of people call a
compromise a "lose-lose" solution

Collaborating means working with other people to make sure that their viewpoints and
perspectives are taken into acount. It's a great way to get a real commitment from
everyone.

Smoothing is what you're doing when you try to play down the problem and make it seem like
it's not so bad. It's a temporary solution, but sometimes you need to do it to keep tempers from
flaring and give people some space to step back and really figure out what's going on.

Forcing means putting your foot down and making a decision. One person wins, one person
loses, and that's the end of that.

Withdrawal doesn't do much good for anyone. It's when people get so frustrated, angry, or
disgusted that they just walk away from the argument. It's almost always counterproductive. If
someone withdraws from a problem before it's resolved, it won't go away-and your project
willsuffer.
