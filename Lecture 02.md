## Project Groups

A process like a machine. Has an input, tools and an output. 

1. Initiation

3. Executing 
4. Monitoring & Controlling
5. Closing

In each group we produce an artifact. An artifact can be document, file, executables. Artifacts for each of these, 

1. Project Charter (Authority document: project objectives, cost, title, duration - A request for execution), Stakeholder Analysis (Who are stakeholders and list)
2. 
- PMP (project management plan)
- Work breakdown structure (breakdown main component into small components which are easily manageable)
- Schedule (times for activities)
- Budget (Includes costs)
- Plan for all 10 knowledge areas compiled as a one

 3. 
 - Resources (Tangible and intangible resources needed)
 - Tasks (workflows)
 - Deliverables ( outcomes of execution )
 - Managed quality
 - Risk responses
 - Procurements (Any purchases of providers,resources, people ...etc)
 - Stakeholder management
 - Communications (Frequency, mediums ..etc)

### Develop Project Charter

- The very first thing that's done on a new project is the development of the project charter. 
- That's the document that authorizes you to do your work. But you're not always involved in making it
- oftentimes it's handed to you by the sponsor.

### Develop Project Management Plan

- The project management plan is the most important document in the entire PMBOKÂ® Guide. because it guides everything that happens on the project.
- It spans all of the knowledge areas.

### Direct and Manage Project Execution

- After you're done planning, it's time to do the work. 
- Your job is to make sure that everybody is doing what they should be doing, and that the products or services your project creates meet the needs of the stakeholders.

### Monitor and Control Project Work

- A good project manager is constantly monitoring every single thing that goes on in the project.
- Perform Integrated Change Control Once you've found problems on your project, you've got to work with
your stakeholders and sponsors to figure out how to deal with those problems.
- You should also update your project management plan to reflect any extra steps you'll need to take to complete the project.
- Updating the project management plan also makes sure everyone working on the project stays on the same page.

### Close Project or Phase

- The last thing you do on the project is close it out.
- Make sure you document everything. (the lessons you and your team have learned along the way).
